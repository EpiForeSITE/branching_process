Description: Quantify outbreak risk posed by individual importers of a transmissible
    pathogen. Input parameters of negative binomial offspring distributions for the
    number of transmissions from each infected individual and initial number of
    infected. Calculate probabilities of final outbreak size, generations of
    transmission, and outbreak size by transmission generation.
