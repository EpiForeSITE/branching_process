## Branching process outbreak simulator

Quantifies risk posed by individual importers of a novel transmissible pathogen to a generic population, with intervention effects. Scenarios modeled: novel introduction of transmissible pathogen by an infected traveler, an accidentally infected laboratory worker, a zoonotic spillover event, or similar scenario. Intervention scenarios for improved detection of initial case and for delayed mitigation after ongoing outbreak is detected.
