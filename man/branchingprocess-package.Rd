\title{Infectious disease outbreak quantification using a branching process model
with negative binomial offspring distribution}
\description{
This package provides functions that quantify infectious disease outbreaks
using a branching process, a stochastic process in which each individual in
generation n produces a random number of individuals in generation n+1,
continuing for some number of generations or until there are no individuals
remaining.
}
\details{
The random number of next-generation individuals produced by each individual
is drawn from the offspring distribution, a discrete probability distribution
with non-negative range. To model infectious disease outbreaks, it is common
to use a negative binomial offspring distribution, parameterized by the mean
\code{R} and dispersion parameter \code{k}. This parameterization is equivalent to
using mu = R and size = k in R's "NegBinomial", e.g. dnbinom(x, mu=R, size=k)
would give the density,  i.e. the probability of exactly x transmissions from
one individual.
